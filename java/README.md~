# Java GO-CAM validator

Java code for validating GO-CAMs against the shex schema can be found in the minerva-core project at https://github.com/geneontology/minerva and can be accessed via the Minerva command line utility as seen in https://github.com/geneontology/minerva/blob/master/build-cli.sh 


It will:

- Enrich each GO-CAM with subclass relations linking instances to root classes 
- then validate the resulting RDF models against the `go-cam-shapes.shex` schema using the `go-cam-shapes.shapeMap` shape map to look up the appropriate focus nodes.  
- It will show errors if the ttl files in the should_pass directories do not validate or if the ttl files in the should_fail directories do validate.
